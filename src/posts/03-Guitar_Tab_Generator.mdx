This tool was created as a school project, where we had to create Generative Art. By experimenting with my passion for music and guitar, I eventually came up with this tool. I have yet to find something similair online, so I'm pretty excited about creating something unique like this.

This tool is not meant to create entire songs, but rather to help guitarists who are looking for some inspiration when creating new music.
